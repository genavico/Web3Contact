# Basic Contact Form Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

The use case is a smart contract demonstrating reading and writing data for a contact form.
